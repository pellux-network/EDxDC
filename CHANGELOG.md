### Known Bugs

- Selecting a system from the left-side external panel results in either 0 or 16 jumps remaining being displayed. This is unfortunately a bug with ED's journaling where it's actually displaying those number as jumps remaining so this will require a fix on Frontier's end
- Arrival screen sometimes displays a few seconds after startup
- Splash screen gets stuck waiting for a destination
- Switching between Local Target and Next Jump views sometimes requires a page scroll.
